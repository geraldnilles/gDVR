 Listing Manager
#################


Option 1 
========

Create a big-ol database that contains all of the shows we want to record as
well as all of the listing information downloaded from the internet

Option 2
========

Create a folder in the filesystem where database files and recordings are
shown.  

I like this option because it lets the database complexity be handled by the by
operating system.   And when someone wants to record something, they just add a
new file to the folder.   I could also allow things like permissions of
different users and write protection which could be cool.

Once the data is downloaded, the listing manager will add items to the
scheduler folder.

Folder Structure
----------------

Channels
........

A folder contain a bunch of "Channel" files.  Each file will contain a list of
shows playing.  Each channel file will be updated periodically (probably once a
day) and the new file will replace the old one each time.



Recordings
..........

A folder containing recordings.  This recording files will be generated by the user.  Each file will have details on a show they want to record. 

Shows
.....

A folder containing a list of shows.  Each show file will contain details about the show.


Status File
............

Each of the folders will contain a status file. This file will contain details
on when the database was last updated so the scheduler knows when the data is
stale and when its fresh
